Read more Feb 20, 2025 | eSports Active streamers on Twitch worldwide 2025 In January 2025, video streaming platform Twitch had approximately 7.7 million active streamers, down from a peak of 9.89 million in January 2021. The platform experienced a boom during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many new users used the platform to connect with friends or try their hand at livestreaming. However, this trend normalized again towards the end of the year, and the streaming space has also grown more competitive as platforms apart from Twitch have evolved to attract streamers and viewers. Popular content categories on Twitch In 2024, most of the leading content categories on Twitch were all gaming-related – except for the top spot: Just Chatting. The general conversation category accumulated 2.8 billion hours of viewing time in the measured period. In October 2023, global Twitch audiences spent around 253 million hours watching Just Chatting content on Twitch, with the average viewer count of such content reaching 347 thousand. KaiCenat was the most popular Just Chatting streamer on Twitch in the most recently measured month. Game streamers Twitch is very popular with gamers and gaming audiences, and the ranking of the most popular Twitch streamers reflects this. Ninja (real name: Richard Tyler Blevins), the top-ranked streamer on Twitch, had 19.14 million followers in December 2024. Ninja saw a meteoric rise to fame when he was one of the first top-ranked players to stream the then-newly released Fortnite Battle Royale at the end of 2017. Second-ranked ibai (real name: Ibai Llanos Garatea) was ranked second with 17.19 million followers on Twitch. With more than 9.4 million followers, Imane Anys, better known as Pokimane, was the only woman among the most-followed Twitch streamers\n",

Read more Feb 17, 2025 | Currencies Market cap ranking of 213 stablecoin on February 17, 2025 A list containing 213 different stablecoins reveals that only two of them had a market cap of over 10 billion USD in 2025. The likes of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are tied (pegged) to a \"real-world\" asset - in their case, the USD - whereas a coin like DAI is connected to the development of other cryptocurrencies. Algorithmic stablecoins have nearly no backing, but use an algorithm that creates more of a particular (crypto) asset within the same blockchain. Stablecoins as a group hit the news frequently in 2022, although only a few featured in a ranking of top 120 cryptocurrencies based on market cap. They are meant to be less volatile than, say, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or Shiba INU (SHIB), or other virtual currencies susceptible to significant price swings. The price of the most well-known stablecoin, Tether (USDT), however, consistently hovers around a single USD as is tied (pegged) to the “real-world” U.S. dollar. As stablecoins are connected to physical currencies, they are not the same as Central Bank-Issued Digital Currencies or CBDC like the digital euro or China's e-CNY - which outright digitalize those same currencies.

        "            backstory=\"Kinetic grew up as a genetic prodigy in the underbelly of a high-tech city. After witnessing the exploitation of human bodies for profit and military purposes, Kinetic set out to use his skills for a higher purpose: creating an ideal human for Mars. He began by experimenting on himself, developing enhanced lung capacities, resistance to radiation, and muscle structure adapted for Mars’ low gravity. However, he has become increasingly obsessed with unlocking the hidden potentials of human DNA, which has led him to consider controversial and potentially dangerous modifications that could transcend humanity as we know it.\",\n",

After he had a ‘vision’ in which the future of humanity was tied to his ability to cultivate mental and emotional resilience, he decided that Mars colonization needed to be a spiritual and psychological endeavor above all.
